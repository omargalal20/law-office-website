            <p style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
                In the current digital age, the way personal information is handled has undergone substantial changes. With online transactions and social media interactions, our digital footprints now contribute to a more detailed portrayal of our lives. Given this growing collection of data, there is a pressing need for strong legal frameworks to safeguard individuals from potential misuse, infringement, and exploitation.

            <h2 style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>Pillars of the New Paradigm:</h2>

            <ol style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
                <li style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
                    The legal framework outlines essential principles that guide the processing of data, covering aspects such as collection, storage, and utilization. Emphasizing transparency, purpose limitation, data minimization, and accountability, these principles form the foundation for responsible data management.
                </li>
                <li style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
                    Empowered Data Subjects: Individuals are afforded increased control over their personal information through the legal provisions, granting rights such as access, rectification, erasure, and the ability to restrict processing. Additionally, the law enables individuals to exercise the right to data portability, facilitating the smooth transfer of their data between different service providers. This empowers individuals with practical tools to manage and move their information as needed.
                </li>
                <li style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
                    Strengthened Security Measures: The law mandates data controllers to establish suitable technical and organizational safeguards, aiming to shield personal data from unauthorized access, disclosure, loss, or damage. Furthermore, the inclusion of data breach notification requirements ensures that individuals are promptly informed in the event of security incidents, emphasizing transparency and accountability in data protection measures.
                </li>
                <li style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
                    Accountability Through Data Protection Officers: As per the legal requirements, organizations are obligated to appoint Data Protection Officers (DPOs). These individuals play a crucial role in overseeing compliance with the regulations and act as intermediaries between data controllers and data subjects. Their responsibilities involve ensuring that the data processing activities align with the established rules, fostering transparency, and facilitating communication in the realm of data protection.

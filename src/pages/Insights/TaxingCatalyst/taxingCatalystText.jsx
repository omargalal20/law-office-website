                    Egypt, strategically positioned at the crossroads of Africa and the Middle East, is undertaking a deliberate effort to stimulate its economic growth. Recognizing the pivotal role of foreign direct investments (FDIs) in driving expansion and job creation, the nation has implemented a strategic overhaul of its investment laws, introducing a range of enticing tax incentives. On 25 July 2023, the Egyptian Parliament published Law No. 160 of 2023 (the “Law”) in the Official Gazette, marking significant amendments to the Investment Law No. 72 of 2017 (the “Investment Law”) in line with the Government's aim to promote a comprehensive and sustainable investment environment by facilitating the process for foreign investors to operate and manage projects in Egypt. Far beyond bureaucratic adjustments, this transformative step is a calculated initiative to position Egypt as an attractive destination for global capital, fostering a vibrant and competitive business environment.

                        Cash Refunds: Companies engaging in specific industrial activities within targeted sectors qualify for generous cash refunds, ranging from 35% to 55% of the corporate tax paid on generated income. This direct financial injection offers immediate relief, enhancing profitability, especially for long-term investment projects.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Reduced Rates: Investors in specified strategic sectors can enjoy reduced corporate tax rates, further easing their fiscal burden and improving returns on investment. This focused approach allows Egypt to incentivize key industries deemed essential for its economic diversification and growth.

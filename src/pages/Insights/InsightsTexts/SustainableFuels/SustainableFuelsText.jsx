                The European Union has taken a major step towards decarbonizing the aviation sector with the adoption of a new regulation on the "RefuelEU Aviation" initiative. This initiative aims to increase the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) and synthetic fuels, which have lower CO2 emissions than fossil fuels, in order to reduce the environmental impact of air travel.

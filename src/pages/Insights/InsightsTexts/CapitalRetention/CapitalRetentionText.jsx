                    On 16 January 2024, Egypt witnessed a significant economic milestone as the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAFI) and the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) announced a groundbreaking policy. Foreign companies operating in Egypt can now retain their capital increase deposits in foreign currency, a departure from the previous requirement for conversion to Egyptian pounds. This move, navigating legal intricacies, promises to unlock economic and business opportunities for both Egypt and its international partners.
